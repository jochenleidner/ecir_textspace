# 2020 ECIR tutorial Text Meets Space: Geographic Content Extraction, Resolution, and Information Retrieval

#### #ecir_textspace

### Summary

This half-day tutorial will be divided into five sessions:

– Geography and text: an introduction to the ways in which geographic concepts
are reflected in natural language and in text;

– Toponym recognition and resolution [9]: key to most geographically inspired
analysis are the use of place-names in text, their identification, disambigua-
tion, and resolution to unique locations;

– Geographic relevance and ranking [4]: methods for incorporating geographic
information in IR indexes and ranking algorithms. Discuss what is geographic
relevance, and how it varies with context and application domain;

– Applications: Concrete examples for the application of the introduced meth-
ods, in fields ranging from Digital Humanities to Web search, together with
a discussion on requirements and their implications on algorithmic and data
choices;

– Future challenges: Where are the most likely applications of GIR in the future,
and what are key societal and methodologically driven challenges;
The first four sessions will each present fundamental challenges, a selection of
examples from the state of the art, and include interactive exercises (computer
and/or paper based) to illustrate basic concepts to participants.

### Data

We will be using two historical texts as our primary datasets in this tutorial: [Samuel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson)'s travel writing about the islands of Scotland and the collection of writings from [James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook) and [Joseph Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks) from their trips on the Endeavour to Australia and elsewhere. Both texts were written in English and published in the lage eighteenth century.
